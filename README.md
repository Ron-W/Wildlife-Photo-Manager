Manage personal wildlife photo collection

Much of the wildlife we see in this country is only around in its most identifiable forms for a very short period of time. For example, some plants only flower for a few weeks, some insects only have adult forms for a similarly short period of time. Some species are not seen for years at a time.

Therefore, when they come around again the name of the species can so easily be forgotten or even misidentified when relying on the memory.

Identifying many species can take up considerable time searching through books and the internet.

This site will enable wildlife photos to be organised so that a quick search of photos of individuals already identified can be easily referred to saving time in looking up already known species.
